# image processor
lets you manipulate images using matrices (blurring, edge detection, etc)   

array gen was supposed to make it easier to make large patterns, but it doesn't work because javascript was being ass

## TODO
 - [x] make 'apply image manipulation' function  
 - [x] add edge detection matrix
 - [x] add a sharpen matrix
 - [ ] add buttons to window to change the affect / revert to normal
 - [ ] maybe change it to event driven not using a loop
